## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your ansible playbook. Once launched, it will install a [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) distributed streaming platform in a Debian system.

### Prerequisities

Ansible 2.2.1.0 version installed.
Inventory destination should be a Debian environment.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) as driver (with [hostmanager](https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/vagrant-hostmanager) plugin) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) as provider.

### Installing

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml):

```
- src: http://github.com/idealista/kafka-role.git
  scm: git
  version: 1.0.0
  name: kafka
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

```
---
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - role: kafka
```
